<h1 align ="center"> About the developer </h1>
<p align = "center"> My name is Yasmeen Munasser. I am a CS Senior Student at Queens College majoring in Computer Science and minoring in
Business and Liberal Arts Honors (BALA). Upon graduating, I want to be a software engineer for a company that represents
diversity and inclusion. I also hope to create my own non-profit organization for women who are interested in CS, but are
discouraged due to lack of support and resources, and create a safe, supportive space for all women. </p>
